Tycho Execution makes it easy to trade on different DEXs by handling the complex encoding for you. Instead of creating
custom code for each DEX, you get a simple, ready-to-use tool that generates the necessary data to execute trades. It's
designed to be safe, straightforward, and quick to set up, so anyone can start trading without extra effort.

For complete documentation, see Tycho docs [here](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/for-solvers/execution).

## Examples
